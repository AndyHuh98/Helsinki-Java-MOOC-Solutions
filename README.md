# Mooc-Fi-Exercises
Assortment of solutions to exercises on Mooc.fi's Java Programming Part I, found here: http://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/.

Note that some of these may not be "Correct" solutions based on their grading software, but they function properly. These are just solutions that I've programmed on my own while I work through their course, without consulting MOOC's automatic grading software. Most of these can just be copied, pasted, and run; and the console results should match MOOC's example results.
